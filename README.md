## 🛠 Technologies Used


|[Python]()|[Pandas]()|[Numpy]()|[Seaborn]()|[Matplotlib]()|[Scikit]()
|-|-|-|-|-|-|

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### ✔ Initial Dataset Checks

   Displayed head and tail of dataset

  Checked dataset shape and data types

  Verified missing values

  Examined target distribution

### ✔ Target Distribution

Counted:

Number of heart disease cases

Number of non-heart disease cases

Visualized the distribution using bar plot

### ✔ Sex-Based Analysis

Counted occurrences of sex

Created crosstab: sex vs target

Visualized using a bar plot

### ✔ Visualizations

Scatter Plot: Age vs Maximum Heart Rate (colored by target)

Age Histogram

Bar Plot: Chest Pain Type vs Target

Correlation Heatmap to identify most influential features

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

Split into train-test sets

Standardized data using StandardScaler

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
1️⃣ Logistic Regression

2️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
